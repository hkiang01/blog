This looks much better in mobile vs desktop.

### Chapter 1

# Philosophy

A few things I believe are true

1. If you automate common tasks you perform, you become your own force multiplier (see [Eliminating Toil](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/eliminating-toil/) in the [Google SRE book](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/toc/index.html)).


2. A feature doesn't exist unless there's a test for it, because manually testing over and over again is just not worth it

3. Tests should only be written against well-known standards, e.g., REST APIs, and avoid being tightly bound to implementation if possible

4. As long as your code has a deadline, it will never be "perfect" (limited time budget).

5. Even if your code doesn't have a deadline, it will never be "perfect" (limited incentive).

6. Companies will never over-provision human resources, just like they will never over-provision cloud resources (or at least shouldn't).

7. "Agile" means something different to everyone, so the term itself doesn't really mean anything. Everyone has an opinion, especially [Deloitte](https://twitter.com/djryan/status/1315063072852242434?s=20).

8. Working near a waterfall is peaceful, but you'll surely get wet while working under one.

9. If you can pass *\<insert regulation\>* audits and still get your job done, you're winning, especially if you can also squeeze in ad-hoc work items during your sprint in a *\<insert regulation\>* compliant fashion.


10. Story estimations are only necessary to those who lack or who have never have had an understanding of the code base(s) they work with, or within large, centrally-planned companies where that is often the case (the planning committee can only have so much understanding).

11. The planning committee rightfully deserves accurate and timely information to do their job, they're human too.

12. Multiple sources of truth muddy the waters. A potential solution: a singular planning committee.

13. There is a right balance w.r.t. the number of planning hours vs non-planning hours, error on the side of too many non-planning hours.

14. A "Best Practice" often refers to the best way the team lead knows how to do something at that point in time. "Best Practices" should change when the team is aware of a demonstrated better way of doing something.

15. "Best Practices" should then be documented for posterity. 

16. Always be learning

17. Posture! Your lower back should be flush with your chair.
