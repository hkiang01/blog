### Chapter 1

# Philosophy

A few things I believe are true, but are just my personal opinions really

1. This looks better on mobile vs desktop

1. If you automate common tasks you perform, you become your own force multiplier (see [Eliminating Toil](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/eliminating-toil/) in the [Google SRE book](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/toc/index.html)).


1. A feature doesn't exist unless there's a test for it, because manually testing over and over again is just not worth it

1. Tests should only be written against well-known standards, e.g., REST APIs, and avoid being tightly bound to implementation if possible

1. As long as your code has a deadline, it will never be "perfect" (limited time budget).

1. Even if your code doesn't have a deadline, it will never be "perfect" (limited incentive).

1. Companies will never over-provision human resources, just like they will never over-provision cloud resources (or at least shouldn't).


1. "Agile" means something different to everyone, so the term itself doesn't really mean anything. Everyone has an opinion, especially [Deloitte](https://twitter.com/djryan/status/1315063072852242434?s=20).

1. Working near a waterfall is peaceful, but working in one is a path to the dark side.

1. If you can pass *\<insert regulation\>* audits and still get your job done, you're winning, especially if you can also squeeze in ad-hoc work items during your sprint in a *\<insert regulation\>* compliant fashion.


1. Story estimations are only necessary to those who lack or never have had an understanding of the code bases they work with, or within large, centrally-planned companies.

1. A "Best Practice" often really refers to the best way the team lead knows how to do something at that point in time, which will change (and should at some point change if they promote continuous learning)

1. Always be learning

1. Posture! Your lower back should be flush with your chair.
